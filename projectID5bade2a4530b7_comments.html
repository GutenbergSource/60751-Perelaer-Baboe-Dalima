<HTML><BODY>Although the number of Dutch in the Dutch East Indies was limited (never more than 100,000 persons), a significant number of books where written. From this heritage of Dutch East Indian literature I am offering a selection in the original Dutch. Whenever an English translation of these works exists, I will also try to offer those.

<p><i>Baboe Dalima; or, The Opium Fiend</i>, from 1886, by M.T.H. Perelaer (1831-1901) is intended as a exposé of the opium trade in the Dutch East Indies, which caused huge misery but yielded the Dutch colonial government huge profits. A great admirer of the famous Dutch author Multatuli, the
author also wanted to emulate the impact of that author's <i>Max Havelaar</i>. And although <i>Baboe Dalima</i> certainly caused a lot of upheaval on publication, especially because of the uncensored depiction of gore and obscenities, from a literary point of view, it isn't as renewing as the work of 
his great example.

<p>Prepared from a copy at Google books, so there are a few scan quality issues, but complete, and I can provide the few unclear words from the Dutch original if needed.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
