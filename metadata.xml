Baboe Dalima; or, The Opium Fiend, by M. T. H. Perelaer (1831–1901) was published in 1886 as an exposé of the opium trade in the Dutch East Indies, which caused huge misery but yielded the Dutch colonial government huge profits. A great admirer of the famous Dutch author Multatuli, Perelaer also wanted to emulate the impact of Multatuli’s Max Havelaar. And although Baboe Dalima certainly caused considerable turmoil after publication, mainly due to the uncensored depiction of gore and obscenities, it wasn’t, from a literary point of view, as revolutionary a work as his great example.
Original Dutch title: Baboe dalima. Opium roman. This translation is slightly abridged.
